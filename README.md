# lens-npe

This repository contains source code for Erickson et al. 2024 "Lens Modeling of 
STRIDES Strongly Lensed Quasars using Neural Posterior Estimation"

Use make_figures.ipynb to reproduce all figures in the paper. 

This code base consists of 
- analysis scripts that call paltas NPE 
- hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) source code  

This code base heavily relies on the use of paltas (). Note that while updates 
from this project are being merged into the paltas main branch, this fork of 
paltas contains all necessary updates:
